VET Sample Module — Basic Electrical Installation (SBC-Aligned)

Module code: VET-BEI-101
Level: Entry / Level 1
Estimated hours: 60 (30 theory, 30 practical)

Competency Outcomes (SBC style)
- CO1: Interpret electrical drawings, specifications and safety protocols.
- CO2: Select appropriate tools and materials for basic installations.
- CO3: Install and test wiring for a single-phase lighting circuit to accepted standards.

Unit Breakdown (per CO)
- Unit 1 (CO1) — Theory: electrical principles, symbol reading, safety (6 hours)
- Unit 2 (CO2) — Tools, material selection, procurement (6 hours)
- Unit 3 (CO3) — Practical installation: conduit, wiring, connections, testing (48 hours)

Teaching & Learning Activities
- Demonstration and guided practice for wiring techniques.
- Small-group workshops where learners install circuits under supervision.
- Safety drills and PPE checks.

Assessment
- Formative: Checklist during practical sessions; short quizzes for theory.
- Summative: Practical performance assessment (observed installation) + written test on theory.

Resources
- Tools: pliers, wire strippers, testers, screwdrivers.
- Consumables: wires, switches, light fittings, conduit.
- Templates: Practical observation checklist (see `assessments/assessment_rubrics.md`).

Adaptation notes for FODE
- Provide step-by-step printed practical guides and photos.
- Use video demonstrations stored on USB/SD for offline viewing.
- Pair learners with local workplace mentors for supervised practice.

Teacher notes
- Emphasise safety and local electrical codes. Allow extra time for learners with limited prior exposure.

Suggestions for localisation
- Map COs to national competency frameworks and update assessment thresholds accordingly.
